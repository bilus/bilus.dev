<h1 class="title">LCM, HCF and Sets</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Published on Aug 01, 2018</p>
</header><p>
Most of us were taught sometime is school that the product of the Lowest
Common Multiple, LCM and the Highest Common Factor, HCF of two numbers
is equal to the product of the numbers. Lately, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about
it and tried to generalize this idea to larger number of numbers. I
don&rsquo;t know if it has already been done but it was a nice eureka moment
for me!
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s start with the case that we are familiar with
\[LCM(a, b) \times HCF(a,b) = a \times b\] where \(a\) and \(b\) are
positive numbers.
</p>

<p>
To convince ourselves that the above statement is true for any two
positive integers \(a\) and \(b\), we can think of the product of the two
numbers as the product of their factors. The two number will have some
factors in common while each of them will have some unique factors.
Let&rsquo;s denote the common factors by \(k_1,k_2 \dots k_c\).
</p>

<p>
\[ \begin{align}
a &= k_1 \times k_2 \dots \times k_c \times a_1 \times a_2 \dots a_m \\
b &= k_1 \times k_2 \dots \times k_c \times b_1 \times b_2 \dots b_n
\end{align} \]
</p>

<p>
where \(a_i\) are factors which are unique to \(a\) and \(b_j\) are factors
unique to \(b\). For the numbers \(6\) and \(10\), the common factor is \(2\).
The factor \(3\) is unique to \(6\) and \(5\) is unique to \(10\).
\[ \begin{align}
6 &= 2 \times 3  \\
10 &= 2 \times 5
\end{align} \]
</p>

<p>
The highest common factor is actually the product of all the factors
common to \(a\) and \(b\). \[ \begin{align}
HCF(a, b) &= k_1 \times k_2 \dots k_{c-1} \times k_c \\
HCF(6, 10) &= 2
\end{align} \]
</p>

<p>
Try looking at the product of the two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) with the
common factors separated to the left end.
\[a \times b = (k_1 \times k_2  \dots k_c) \times (a_1 \times a_2 \dots a_m \times
k_1 \times k_2 \dots k_c \times b_1 \times b_2 \dots \times b_n)\]<br>
= { Replacing the product of common factors by \(HCF(a, b)\) }
\[a \times b = HCF(a, b)\times (a_1 \times a_2 \dots a_m \times k_1 \times k_2
\dots k_c \times b_1 \times b_2 \dots b_n)\]
</p>

<p>
Now let&rsquo;s focus all our concentration on the product in parenthesis on
the right hand side, i.e.
\[a_1 \times a_2 \dots a_m \times k_1 \times k_2 \dots k_c \times b_1 \times b_2 \dots b_n\]
</p>

<p>
Can you see that this number is a multiple of both \(a\) and \(b\). If you
collect the \(k_i\)&rsquo;s and merge them with \(a_i\)&rsquo;s, you get \(a\).
Alternatively, if you merge the \(k_i\)&rsquo;s with the \(b_i\)&rsquo;s, you get \(b\).
Since we will be referring to the product a lot, let me bind a shorter
name to it.
\[CM = a_1 \times a_2 \dots a_m \times k_1 \times k_2 \dots k_c \times b_1
\times b_2 \dots b_n\] \(CM\) stands for a <i>common multiple</i> of \(a\) and
\(b\). Now we need to show that \(CM\) is indeed the <i>Lowest</i> Common
Multiple.
</p>

<p>
The most trivial common multiple that one can come up with for two
number is really the product of the numbers. Now to obtain a lower
common multiple, all we need to do is take out factors which are common
to both the numbers. If a factor \(k\) is common to \(a\) and \(b\), even
after taking one such factor out, a copy of \(k\) remains in the product!
So the more we can take out factors from the product, the smaller the
common factor we&rsquo;ll obtain. The largest piece that we can take out is
really the \(HCF\). That should and would leave us with the \(LCM\) in the
product.
</p>

<p>
So, we have somehow informally convinced ourselves of the fact that
\[ a \times b = HCF(a, b) \times LCM(a,b) \] If you couldn&rsquo;t wrap your
head around the idea, spend some time thinking about it.
</p>

<p>
<b>How can we extend this to larger number of numbers?</b><br>
Here&rsquo;s the neat idea! I will show this to you with the help of an
example. Let&rsquo;s take three numbers&#x2013; 30, 12 and 15. Factorize each of
them. \[30 = 2 \times 3 \times 5\] \[12 = 2 \times 2 \times 3\]
\[15 = 3 \times 5\]
</p>

<p>
To treat each factor as a unique object for a number, we will use
subscripts as labels. \(12\) has two \(2\)&rsquo;s. So one of them becomes \(2_1\)
and the other becomes \(2_2\).<br>
Think of them as mental labels such that they don&rsquo;t change the nature of
the object that is labeled, i.e. \(5_1\) is nothing but the number \(5\).
</p>

<p>
Now we have \[30 = 2_1 \times 3_1 \times 5_1\]
\[12 = 2_1 \times 2_2 \times 3_1\] \[15 = 3_1 \times 5_1 \]
</p>

<p>
Now, we can think of each of the numbers as a set of objects, namely
labeled factors. \[ S(30) = \left\{ 2_1, 3_1, 5_1 \right\} \]
\[ S(12) = \left\{ 2_1, 2_2, 3_1 \right\} \]
\[ S(15) = \left\{ 3_1, 5_1 \right\} \]
</p>

<p>
Now, think for a while about the intersection of two sets and try to
figure out how it may relate to the two numbers. When I say a number, I
may refer to the set of factors that constitute the number and
vice-versa.
</p>

<p>
Yes, you got it right! The intersection of two sets is the set of common
elements which is equivalent to the set that represents the \(HCF\) of the
numbers represented by the sets. And it&rsquo;s easy to see that \(LCM\) is the
union of sets in our set-space representation of numbers. Too much of
dance of terms!
</p>

<p>
\[ S(30) \cap S(12) \cap S(15) = \left\{ 3_1 \right\} \] And \(3\) is
indeed the \(HCF\) of 30, 12 and 15.
\[ S(30) \cup S(12) \cup S(15) = \left\{ 2_1, 2_2, 3_1, 5_1 \right\} \]
And \(2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5 = 60\) is indeed the \(LCM\) of the three
numbers.
</p>

<p>
Now, you must be familiar with the famous equation from Set Theory&#x2013;
\[ A \cup B = A + B - (A \cap B) \] You can either work in the set-space
where each number is represented as the set of its factors or do some
translations right in the number-space to obtain the relationship
implied by the above equation. Translate each \(+\) to multiplication and
\(-\) to division, along with the above relations that we found for union
and intersection. The equation easily becomes
\[ LCM(A, B) = \frac{A \times B}{HCF(A, B)} \]
</p>

<p>
Aha! Now let&rsquo;s go for three sets! We already know,
\[ A \cup B \cup C = A + B + C - (A \cap B) - (B \cap C) - (C \cap A) + (A \cap B \cap C) \]
</p>

<p>
Doing the same set of translations to this equation, we have our little
jewel&#x2013;
\[ LCM(A, B, C) = \frac{A \times B \times C \times HCF(A, B, C)}{HCF(A, B) \times HCF(B,C) \times HCF(C,A)} \]
</p>

<p>
You can verify it for our near and dear companion numbers so far.
\[LCM(12,15,30) = 60 \] And,
\[\frac{12 \times 15 \times 30 \times HCF(12, 15, 30)}
{HCF(12,15) \times HCF(15,30) \times HCF(30, 12)}\]
\[ = \frac{12 \times 15 \times 30 \times 3} {3 \times 15 \times 6} \]
\[ = 60 \]
